		>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Immer (German for: always) is a tiny package that allows you to work with
	immutable state in a more convenient way. It is based on the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"
		><em>copy-on-write</em></a
	>
	mechanism.
</p>
<p>
	The basic idea is that you will apply all your changes to a temporary
	<em>draftState</em>, which is a proxy of the <em>currentState</em>. Once all
	your mutations are completed, Immer will produce the <em>nextState</em> based
	on the mutations to the draft state. This means that you can interact with
	your data by simply modifying it while keeping all the benefits of immutable
	data.
</p>
<p><img src="images/hd/immer.png" alt="immer-hd.png" /></p>
<p>
	Using Immer is like having a personal assistant; he takes a letter (the
	current state) and gives you a copy (draft) to jot changes onto. Once you are
	done, the assistant will take your draft and produce the real immutable, final
	letter for you (the next state).
</p>
<p>
	A mindful reader might notice that this is quite similar to
	<code>withMutations</code> of ImmutableJS. It is indeed, but generalized and
	applied to plain, native JavaScript data structures (arrays and objects)
	without further needing any library.

<h2>API</h2>
<p>The Immer package exposes a default function that does all the work.</p>
<p>
	<code
		>produce(currentState, producer: (draftState) =&gt; void): nextState</code
	>
</p>
<p>
	There is also a curried overload that is explained
	<a href="#currying">below</a>.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

const baseState = [
	{
		todo: &quot;Learn typescript&quot;,
		done: true
	},
	{
		todo: &quot;Try immer&quot;,
		done: false
	}
]

const nextState = produce(baseState, draftState =&gt; {
	draftState.push({todo: &quot;Tweet about it&quot;})
	draftState[1].done = true
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	The interesting thing about Immer is that the <code>baseState</code> will be
	untouched, but the <code>nextState</code> will reflect all changes made to
	<code>draftState</code>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// the new item is only added to the next state,
// base state is unmodified
expect(baseState.length).toBe(2)
expect(nextState.length).toBe(3)

// same for the changed 'done' prop
expect(baseState[1].done).toBe(false)
expect(nextState[1].done).toBe(true)

// unchanged data is structurally shared
expect(nextState[0]).toBe(baseState[0])
// changed data not (d√ªh)
expect(nextState[1]).not.toBe(baseState[1])
</code></pre>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Immutability with normal JavaScript objects and arrays. No new APIs to
		learn!
	</li>
	<li>Strongly typed, no string based paths selectors etc.</li>
	<li>Structural sharing out of the box</li>
	<li>Object freezing out of the box</li>
	<li>Deep updates are a breeze</li>
	<li>Boilerplate reduction. Less noise, more concise code.</li>
	<li>
		Small

				alt="size"
		/></a>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Read further to see all these benefits explained.</p>
<h2>Reducer Example</h2>
<p>
	Here is a simple example of the difference that Immer could make in practice.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Redux reducer
// Shortened, based on: https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/examples/shopping-cart/src/reducers/products.js
const byId = (state, action) =&gt; {
	switch (action.type) {
		case RECEIVE_PRODUCTS:
			return {
				...state,
				...action.products.reduce((obj, product) =&gt; {
					obj[product.id] = product
					return obj
				}, {})
			}
		default:
			return state
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>After using Immer, that simply becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

const byId = (state, action) =&gt;
	produce(state, draft =&gt; {
		switch (action.type) {
			case RECEIVE_PRODUCTS:
				action.products.forEach(product =&gt; {
					draft[product.id] = product
				})
		}
	})
</code></pre>
<p>
	Notice that it is not needed to handle the default case, a producer that
	doesn't do anything will simply return the original state.
</p>
<p>
	Creating Redux reducer is just a sample application of the Immer package.
	Immer is not just designed to simplify Redux reducers. It can be used in any
	context where you have an immutable data tree that you want to clone and
	modify (with structural sharing).
</p>
<p>
	<em
		>Note: it might be tempting after using producers for a while, to just place
		<code>produce</code> in your root reducer and then pass the draft to each
		reducer and work directly over such draft. Don't do that. It kills the point
		of Redux where each reducer is testable as pure reducer. Immer is best used
		when applying it to small individual pieces of logic.</em
	>
</p>
<h2>React.setState example</h2>
<p>
	Deep updates in the state of React components can be greatly simplified as
	well by using immer. Take for example the following onClick handlers (Try in
	<a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/m4yp57632j">codesandbox</a>):
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">/**
 * Classic React.setState with a deep merge
 */
onBirthDayClick1 = () =&gt; {
	this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({
		user: {
			...prevState.user,
			age: prevState.user.age + 1
		}
	}))
}

/**
 * ...But, since setState accepts functions,
 * we can just create a curried producer and further simplify!
 */
onBirthDayClick2 = () =&gt; {
	this.setState(
		produce(draft =&gt; {
			draft.user.age += 1
		})
	)
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Currying</h2>
<p>
	Passing a function as the first argument to <code>produce</code> is intended
	to be used for currying. This means that you get a pre-bound producer that
	only needs a state to produce the value from. The producer function gets
	passed in the draft and any further arguments that were passed to the curried
	function.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// mapper will be of signature (state, index) =&gt; state
const mapper = produce((draft, index) =&gt; {
	draft.index = index
})

// example usage
console.dir([{}, {}, {}].map(mapper))
//[{index: 0}, {index: 1}, {index: 2}])
</code></pre>
<p>
	This mechanism can also nicely be leveraged to further simplify our example
	reducer:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

const byId = produce((draft, action) =&gt; {
	switch (action.type) {
		case RECEIVE_PRODUCTS:
			action.products.forEach(product =&gt; {
				draft[product.id] = product
			})
			return
	}
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that <code>state</code> is now factored out (the created reducer will
	accept a state, and invoke the bound producer with it).
</p>
<p>
	If you want to initialize an uninitialized state using this construction, you
	can do so by passing the initial state as second argument to
	<code>produce</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

const byId = produce(
	(draft, action) =&gt; {
		switch (action.type) {
			case RECEIVE_PRODUCTS:
				action.products.forEach(product =&gt; {
					draft[product.id] = product
				})
				return
		}
	},
	{
		1: {id: 1, name: &quot;product-1&quot;}
	}
)
</code></pre>
<h5>Fun with currying</h5>
<p>
	A random fun example just for inspiration: a neat trick is to turn
	<code>Object.assign</code> into a producer to create a &quot;spread&quot;
	function that is smarter than the normal spread operator, as it doesn't
	produce a new state if the result doesn't actually change (<a
		href="https://twitter.com/mweststrate/status/1045059430256119809"
		>details &amp; explanation</a
	>). Quick example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;
const spread = produce(Object.assign)

const base = {x: 1, y: 1}

console.log({...base, y: 1} === base) // false
console.log(spread(base, {y: 1}) === base) // true! base is recycled as no actual new value was produced
console.log(spread(base, {y: 2}) === base) // false, produced a new object as it should
</code></pre>
<h2>Patches</h2>
<p>
	During the run of a producer, Immer can record all the patches that would
	replay the changes made by the reducer. This is a very powerful tool if you
	want to fork your state temporarily and replay the changes to the original.
</p>
<p>Patches are useful in few scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		To exchange incremental updates with other parties, for example over
		websockets
	</li>
	<li>
		For debugging / traces, to see precisely how state is changed over time
	</li>
	<li>
		As basis for undo/redo or as an approach to replay changes on a slightly
		different state tree
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To help with replaying patches, <code>applyPatches</code> comes in handy. Here
	is an example how patches could be used to record the incremental updates and
	(inverse) apply them:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce, {applyPatches} from &quot;immer&quot;

let state = {
	name: &quot;Micheal&quot;,
	age: 32
}

// Let's assume the user is in a wizard, and we don't know whether
// his changes should end up in the base state ultimately or not...
let fork = state
// all the changes the user made in the wizard
let changes = []
// the inverse of all the changes made in the wizard
let inverseChanges = []

fork = produce(
	fork,
	draft =&gt; {
		draft.age = 33
	},
	// The third argument to produce is a callback to which the patches will be fed
	(patches, inversePatches) =&gt; {
		changes.push(...patches)
		inverseChanges.push(...inversePatches)
	}
)

// In the meantime, our original state is replaced, as, for example,
// some changes were received from the server
state = produce(state, draft =&gt; {
	draft.name = &quot;Michel&quot;
})

// When the wizard finishes (successfully) we can replay the changes that were in the fork onto the *new* state!
state = applyPatches(state, changes)

// state now contains the changes from both code paths!
expect(state).toEqual({
	name: &quot;Michel&quot;, // changed by the server
	age: 33 // changed by the wizard
})

// Finally, even after finishing the wizard, the user might change his mind and undo his changes...
state = applyPatches(state, inverseChanges)
expect(state).toEqual({
	name: &quot;Michel&quot;, // Not reverted
	age: 32 // Reverted
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	The generated patches are similar (but not the same) to the
	<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC-6902 JSON patch standard</a>,
	except that the <code>path</code> property is an array, rather than a string.
	This makes processing patches easier. If you want to normalize to the official
	specification, <code>patch.path = patch.path.join(&quot;/&quot;)</code> should
	do the trick. Anyway, this is what a bunch of patches and their inverse could
	look like:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
	{
		&quot;op&quot;: &quot;replace&quot;,
		&quot;path&quot;: [&quot;profile&quot;],
		&quot;value&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Veria&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 5}
	},
	{&quot;op&quot;: &quot;remove&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: [&quot;tags&quot;, 3]}
]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
	{&quot;op&quot;: &quot;replace&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: [&quot;profile&quot;], &quot;value&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Noa&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 6}},
	{&quot;op&quot;: &quot;add&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: [&quot;tags&quot;, 3], &quot;value&quot;: &quot;kiddo&quot;}
]
</code></pre>
<h3><code>produceWithPatches</code></h3>
<p>
	Instead of setting up a patch listener, an easier way to obtain the patches is
	to use <code>produceWithPatches</code>, which has the same signature as
	<code>produce</code>, except that it doesn't return just the next state, but a
	tuple consisting of <code>[nextState, patches, inversePatches]</code>. Like
	<code>produce</code>, <code>produceWithPatches</code> supports currying as
	well.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import {produceWithPatches} from &quot;immer&quot;

const [nextState, patches, inversePatches] = produceWithPatches(
	{
		age: 33
	},
	draft =&gt; {
		draft.age++
	}
)
</code></pre>
<p>Which produces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">;[
	{
		age: 34
	},
	[
		{
			op: &quot;replace&quot;,
			path: [&quot;age&quot;],
			value: 34
		}
	],
	[
		{
			op: &quot;replace&quot;,
			path: [&quot;age&quot;],
			value: 33
		}
	]
]
</code></pre>

</p>
<h2>Async producers</h2>
<p>
	It is allowed to return Promise objects from recipes. Or, in other words, to
	use <code>async / await</code>. This can be pretty useful for long running
	processes, that only produce the new object once the promise chain resolves.
	Note that <code>produce</code> itself (even in the curried form) will return a
	promise if the producer is async. Example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

const user = {
	name: &quot;michel&quot;,
	todos: []
}

const loadedUser = await produce(user, async function(draft) {
	draft.todos = await (await window.fetch(&quot;http://host/&quot; + draft.name)).json()
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	<em
		>Warning: please note that the draft shouldn't be 'leaked' from the async
		process and stored else where. The draft will still be revoked as soon as
		the async process completes.</em
	>
</p>
<h2><code>createDraft</code> and <code>finishDraft</code></h2>
<p>
	<code>createDraft</code> and <code>finishDraft</code> are two low-level
	functions that are mostly useful for libraries that build abstractions on top
	of immer. It avoids the need to always create a function in order to work with
	drafts. Instead, one can create a draft, modify it, and at some time in the
	future finish the draft, in which case the next immutable state will be
	produced. We could for example rewrite our above example as:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import {createDraft, finishDraft} from &quot;immer&quot;

const user = {
	name: &quot;michel&quot;,
	todos: []
}

const draft = createDraft(user)
draft.todos = await (await window.fetch(&quot;http://host/&quot; + draft.name)).json()
const loadedUser = finishDraft(draft)
</code></pre>
<p>
	Note: <code>finishDraft</code> takes a <code>patchListener</code> as second
	argument, which can be used to record the patches, similarly to
	<code>produce</code>.
</p>
<p>
	<em
		>Warning: in general, we recommend to use <code>produce</code> instead of
		the <code>createDraft</code> / <code>finishDraft</code> combo,
		<code>produce</code> is less error prone in usage, and more clearly
		separates the concepts of mutability and immutability in your code base.</em
	>
</p>
<h2>Returning data from producers</h2>
<p>
	It is not needed to return anything from a producer, as Immer will return the
	(finalized) version of the <code>draft</code> anyway. However, it is allowed
	to just <code>return draft</code>.
</p>
<p>
	It is also allowed to return arbitrarily other data from the producer
	function. But <em>only</em> if you didn't modify the draft. This can be useful
	to produce an entirely new state. Some examples:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const userReducer = produce((draft, action) =&gt; {
	switch (action.type) {
		case &quot;renameUser&quot;:
			// OK: we modify the current state
			draft.users[action.payload.id].name = action.payload.name
			return draft // same as just 'return'
		case &quot;loadUsers&quot;:
			// OK: we return an entirely new state
			return action.payload
		case &quot;adduser-1&quot;:
			// NOT OK: This doesn't do change the draft nor return a new state!
			// It doesn't modify the draft (it just redeclares it)
			// In fact, this just doesn't do anything at all
			draft = {users: [...draft.users, action.payload]}
			return
		case &quot;adduser-2&quot;:
			// NOT OK: modifying draft *and* returning a new state
			draft.userCount += 1
			return {users: [...draft.users, action.payload]}
		case &quot;adduser-3&quot;:
			// OK: returning a new state. But, unnecessary complex and expensive
			return {
				userCount: draft.userCount + 1,
				users: [...draft.users, action.payload]
			}
		case &quot;adduser-4&quot;:
			// OK: the immer way
			draft.userCount += 1
			draft.users.push(action.payload)
			return
	}
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	<em
		>Note: It is not possible to return <code>undefined</code> this way, as it
		is indistinguishable from <em>not</em> updating the draft! Read on...</em
	>
</p>
<h2>Producing <code>undefined</code> using <code>nothing</code></h2>
<p>
	So, in general, one can replace the current state by just
	<code>return</code>ing a new value from the producer, rather than modifying
	the draft. There is a subtle edge case however: if you try to write a producer
	that wants to replace the current state with <code>undefined</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">produce({}, draft =&gt; {
	// don't do anything
})
</code></pre>
<p>Versus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">produce({}, draft =&gt; {
	// Try to return undefined from the producer
	return undefined
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	The problem is that in JavaScript a function that doesn't return anything also
	returns <code>undefined</code>! So immer cannot differentiate between those
	different cases. So, by default, Immer will assume that any producer that
	returns <code>undefined</code> just tried to modify the draft.
</p>
<p>
	However, to make it clear to Immer that you intentionally want to produce the
	value <code>undefined</code>, you can return the built-in token
	<code>nothing</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce, {nothing} from &quot;immer&quot;

const state = {
	hello: &quot;world&quot;
}

produce(state, draft =&gt; {})
produce(state, draft =&gt; undefined)
// Both return the original state: { hello: &quot;world&quot;}

produce(state, draft =&gt; nothing)
// Produces a new state, 'undefined'
</code></pre>
<p>
	N.B. Note that this problem is specific for the <code>undefined</code> value,
	any other value, including <code>null</code>, doesn't suffer from this issue.
</p>
<h2>Inline shortcuts using <code>void</code></h2>
<p>
	Draft mutations in Immer usually warrant a code block, since a return denotes
	an overwrite. Sometimes that can stretch code a little more than you might be
	comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
	In such cases, you can use javascripts
	<a
		href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void"
		><code>void</code></a
	>
	operator, which evaluates expressions and returns <code>undefined</code>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Single mutation
produce(draft =&gt; void (draft.user.age += 1))

// Multiple mutations
produce(draft =&gt; void ((draft.user.age += 1), (draft.user.height = 186)))
</code></pre>
<p>
	Code style is highly personal, but for code bases that are to be understood by
	many, we recommend to stick to the classic
	<code>draft =&gt; { draft.user.age += 1}</code> to avoid cognitive overhead.
</p>
<h2>Extracting the original object from a proxied instance</h2>
<p>
	Immer exposes a named export <code>original</code> that will get the original
	object from the proxied instance inside <code>produce</code> (or return
	<code>undefined</code> for unproxied values). A good example of when this can
	be useful is when searching for nodes in a tree-like state using strict
	equality.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {original} from &quot;immer&quot;

const baseState = {users: [{name: &quot;Richie&quot;}]}
const nextState = produce(baseState, draftState =&gt; {
	original(draftState.users) // is === baseState.users
})
</code></pre>
<p>
	Just want to know if a value is a proxied instance? Use the
	<code>isDraft</code> function!
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {isDraft} from &quot;immer&quot;

const baseState = {users: [{name: &quot;Bobby&quot;}]}
const nextState = produce(baseState, draft =&gt; {
	isDraft(draft) // =&gt; true
	isDraft(draft.users) // =&gt; true
	isDraft(draft.users[0]) // =&gt; true
})
isDraft(nextState) // =&gt; false
</code></pre>
<h2>Auto freezing</h2>
<p>
	Immer automatically freezes any state trees that are modified using
	<code>produce</code>. This protects against accidental modifications of the
	state tree outside of a producer. This comes with a performance impact, so it
	is recommended to disable this option in production. It is by default enabled.
	By default, it is turned on during local development and turned off in
	production. Use <code>setAutoFreeze(true / false)</code> to explicitly turn
	this feature on or off.
</p>
<p>
	<em
		>‚ö†Ô∏è If auto freezing is enabled, recipes are not entirely side-effect free:
		Any plain object or array that ends up in the produced result, will be
		frozen, even when these objects were not frozen before the start of the
		producer! ‚ö†Ô∏è</em
	>
</p>
<h2>Immer on older JavaScript environments?</h2>
<p>
	By default <code>produce</code> tries to use proxies for optimal performance.
	However, on older JavaScript engines <code>Proxy</code> is not available. For
	example, when running Microsoft Internet Explorer or React Native (&lt; v0.59)
	on Android. In such cases, Immer will fallback to an ES5 compatible
	implementation which works identical, but is a bit slower.
</p>
<h2>Importing immer</h2>
<p>
	<code>produce</code> is exposed as the default export, but optionally it can
	be used as name import as well, as this benefits some older project setups. So
	the following imports are all correct, where the first is recommended:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;
import {produce} from &quot;immer&quot;

const {produce} = require(&quot;immer&quot;)
const produce = require(&quot;immer&quot;).produce
const produce = require(&quot;immer&quot;).default

import unleashTheMagic from &quot;immer&quot;
import {produce as unleashTheMagic} from &quot;immer&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Supported object types</h2>
<p>Plain objects and arrays are always drafted by Immer.</p>
<p>
	Every other object must use the <code>immerable</code> symbol to mark itself
	as compatible with Immer. When one of these objects is mutated within a
	producer, its prototype is preserved between copies.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {immerable} from &quot;immer&quot;

class Foo {
	[immerable] = true // Option 1

	constructor() {
		this[immerable] = true // Option 2
	}
}

Foo[immerable] = true // Option 3
</code></pre>
<p>
	For arrays, only numeric properties and the <code>length</code> property can
	be mutated. Custom properties are not preserved on arrays.
</p>
<p>
	When working with <code>Date</code> objects, you should always create a new
	<code>Date</code> instance instead of mutating an existing
	<code>Date</code> object.
</p>
<p>
	Built-in classes like <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> are not supported.
	As a workaround, you should clone them before mutating them in a producer:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const state = {
	set: new Set(),
	map: new Map()
}
const nextState = produce(state, draft =&gt; {
	// Don't use any Set methods, as that mutates the instance!
	draft.set.add(&quot;foo&quot;) // ‚ùå

	// 1. Instead, clone the set (just once)
	const newSet = new Set(draft.set) // ‚úÖ

	// 2. Mutate the clone (just in this producer)
	newSet.add(&quot;foo&quot;)

	// 3. Update the draft with the new set
	draft.set = newSet

	// Similarly, don't use any Map methods.
	draft.map.set(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;) // ‚ùå

	// 1. Instead, clone the map (just once)
	const newMap = new Map(draft.map) // ‚úÖ

	// 2. Mutate it
	newMap.set(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)

	// 3. Update the draft
	draft.map = newMap
})
</code></pre>
<h2>TypeScript or Flow</h2>
<p>
	The Immer package ships with type definitions inside the package, which should
	be picked up by TypeScript and Flow out of the box and without further
	configuration.
</p>
<p>
	The TypeScript typings automatically remove <code>readonly</code> modifiers
	from your draft types and return a value that matches your original type. See
	this practical example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

interface State {
	readonly x: number
}

// `x` cannot be modified here
const state: State = {
	x: 0
}

const newState = produce(state, draft =&gt; {
	// `x` can be modified here
	draft.x++
})

// `newState.x` cannot be modified here
</code></pre>
<p>
	This ensures that the only place you can modify your state is in your produce
	callbacks. It even works recursively and with <code>ReadonlyArray</code>s!
</p>
<p>
	For curried reducers, the type is inferred from the first argument of recipe
	function, so make sure to type it. The <code>Draft</code> utility type can be
	used if the state argument type is immutable:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import produce, {Draft} from &quot;immer&quot;

interface State {
	readonly x: number
}

// `x` cannot be modified here
const state: State = {
	x: 0
}

const increment = produce((draft: Draft&lt;State&gt;, inc: number) =&gt; {
	// `x` can be modified here
	draft.x += inc
})

const newState = increment(state, 2)
// `newState.x` cannot be modified here
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Immer v1.9+ supports TypeScript v3.1+ only.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Immer v3.0+ supports TypeScript v3.4+ only.</p>
<h1>Pitfalls</h1>
<ol>
	<li>
		Don't redefine draft like, <code>draft = myCoolNewState</code>. Instead,
		either modify the <code>draft</code> or return a new state. See
		<a href="#returning-data-from-producers">Returning data from producers</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Immer assumes your state to be a unidirectional tree. That is, no object
		should appear twice in the tree, and there should be no circular references.
	</li>
	<li>
		Since Immer uses proxies, reading huge amounts of data from state comes with
		an overhead (especially in the ES5 implementation). If this ever becomes an
		issue (measure before you optimize!), do the current state analysis before
		entering the producer function or read from the
		<code>currentState</code> rather than the <code>draftState</code>. Also,
		realize that immer is opt-in everywhere, so it is perfectly fine to manually
		write super performance critical reducers, and use immer for all the normal
		ones. Also note that <code>original</code> can be used to get the original
		state of an object, which is cheaper to read.
	</li>
	<li>
		Always try to pull <code>produce</code> 'up', for example
		<code>for (let x of y) produce(base, d =&gt; d.push(x))</code> is
		exponentially slower than
		<code>produce(base, d =&gt; { for (let x of y) d.push(x)})</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		It is possible to return values from producers, except, it is not possible
		to return <code>undefined</code> that way, as it is indistinguishable from
		not updating the draft at all! If you want to replace the draft with
		<code>undefined</code>, just return <code>nothing</code> from the producer.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>How does Immer work?</h2>

</p>
<h2>Example patterns.</h2>
<p><em>For those who have to go back to thinking in object updates :-)</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import produce from &quot;immer&quot;

// object mutations
const todosObj = {
	id1: {done: false, body: &quot;Take out the trash&quot;},
	id2: {done: false, body: &quot;Check Email&quot;}
}

// add
const addedTodosObj = produce(todosObj, draft =&gt; {
	draft[&quot;id3&quot;] = {done: false, body: &quot;Buy bananas&quot;}
})

// delete
const deletedTodosObj = produce(todosObj, draft =&gt; {
	delete draft[&quot;id1&quot;]
})

// update
const updatedTodosObj = produce(todosObj, draft =&gt; {
	draft[&quot;id1&quot;].done = true
})

// array mutations
const todosArray = [
	{id: &quot;id1&quot;, done: false, body: &quot;Take out the trash&quot;},
	{id: &quot;id2&quot;, done: false, body: &quot;Check Email&quot;}
]

// add
const addedTodosArray = produce(todosArray, draft =&gt; {
	draft.push({id: &quot;id3&quot;, done: false, body: &quot;Buy bananas&quot;})
})

// delete
const deletedTodosArray = produce(todosArray, draft =&gt; {
	draft.splice(draft.findIndex(todo =&gt; todo.id === &quot;id1&quot;), 1)
	// or (slower):
	// return draft.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== &quot;id1&quot;)
})

// update
const updatedTodosArray = produce(todosArray, draft =&gt; {
	draft[draft.findIndex(todo =&gt; todo.id === &quot;id1&quot;)].done = true
})
</code></pre>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
	Here is a <a href="__performance_tests__/todo.js">simple benchmark</a> on the
	performance of Immer. This test takes 50,000 todo items and updates 5,000 of
	them. <em>Freeze</em> indicates that the state tree has been frozen after
	producing it. This is a <em>development</em> best practice, as it prevents
	developers from accidentally modifying the state tree.
</p>
<p>
	These tests were executed on Node 9.3.0. Use <code>yarn test:perf</code> to
	reproduce them locally.
</p>
<p><img src="images/performance.png" alt="performance.png" /></p>
<p>Most important observation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Immer with proxies is roughly speaking twice to three times slower as a
		handwritten reducer (the above test case is worst case, see
		<code>yarn test:perf</code> for more tests). This is in practice negligible.
	</li>
	<li>
		Immer is roughly as fast as ImmutableJS. However, the
		<em>immutableJS + toJS</em> makes clear the cost that often needs to be paid
		later; converting the immutableJS objects back to plain objects, to be able
		to pass them to components, over the network etc... (And there is also the
		upfront cost of converting data received from e.g. the server to immutable
		JS)
	</li>
	<li>Generating patches doesn't significantly slow down immer</li>
	<li>
		The ES5 fallback implementation is roughly twice as slow as the proxy
		implementation, in some cases worse.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration</h2>
<p><strong>Immer 2.* -&gt; 3.0</strong></p>
<p>
	In your producers, make sure you're not treating <code>this</code> as the
	draft. (see here: https://github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/308)
</p>
<p>Upgrade to <code>typescript@^3.4</code> if you're a TypeScript user.</p>
<p><strong>Immer 1.* -&gt; 2.0</strong></p>
<p>
	Make sure you don't return any promises as state, because
	<code>produce</code> will actually invoke the promise and wait until it
	settles.
</p>
<p><strong>Immer 2.1 -&gt; 2.2</strong></p>
<p>
	When using TypeScript, for curried reducers that are typed in the form
	<code>produce&lt;Type&gt;((arg) =&gt; { })</code>, rewrite this to
	<code>produce((arg: Type) =&gt; { })</code> or
	<code>produce((arg: Draft&lt;Type&gt;) =&gt; { })</code> for correct
	inference.
