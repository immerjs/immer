 * If only one argument is passed, this is interpreted as the recipe, and will create a curried function that will execute the recipe
 * any time it is called with a base state
 *
 * @param currentState - the state to start with
 * @param thunk - function that receives a proxy of the current state as first argument and which can be freely modified
 * @returns The next state: a new state, or the current state if nothing was modified
