The Immer package exposes a default function that does all the work.

`produce(currentState, recipe: (draftState) => void): nextState`

`produce` takes a base state, and a _recipe_ that can be used to perform all the desired mutations on the `draft` that is passed in. The interesting thing about Immer is that the `baseState` will be untouched, but the `nextState` will reflect all changes made to `draftState`.

Inside the recipe, all standard JavaScript APIs can be used on the `draft` object, including field assignments, `delete` operations, and mutating array, Map and Set operations like `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `set`, `sort`, `remove`, etc.

Any of those mutations don't have to happen at the root, but it is allowed to modify anything anywhere deep inside the draft: `draft.todos[0].tags["urgent"].author.age = 56`

Note that the recipe function itself normally doesn't return anything. However, it is possible to return in case you want to replace the `draft` object in its entirety with another object, for more details see [returning new data](return).

## Example

```javascript
import produce from "immer"

const baseState = [
	{
		title: "Learn TypeScript",
		done: true
	},
	{
		title: "Try Immer",
		done: false
	}
]

const nextState = produce(baseState, draftState => {
	draftState.push({title: "Tweet about it"})
	draftState[1].done = true
})
```

```javascript
// the new item is only added to the next state,
// base state is unmodified
expect(baseState.length).toBe(2)
expect(nextState.length).toBe(3)

// same for the changed 'done' prop
expect(baseState[1].done).toBe(false)
expect(nextState[1].done).toBe(true)

// unchanged data is structurally shared
expect(nextState[0]).toBe(baseState[0])
// ...but changed data isn't.
expect(nextState[1]).not.toBe(baseState[1])
```

### Terminology

- `(base)state`, the immutable state passed to `produce`
- `recipe`: the second argument of `produce`, that captures how the base state should be "mutated".
- `draft`: the first argument of any `recipe`, which is a proxy to the original base state that can be safely mutated.
- `producer`. A function that uses `produce` and is generally of the form `(baseState, ...arguments) => resultState`

Note that it isn't strictly necessary to name the first argument of the recipe `draft`. You can name it anything you want, for example `users`. Using `draft` as a name is just a convention to signal: "mutation is OK here".
