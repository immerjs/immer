Passing a function as the first argument to `produce` creates a function that doesn't apply `produce` yet to a specific state, but rather creates a function that will apply `produce` to any state that is passed to it in the future. This generally is called _currying_. Take for example the following example:

```javascript
import {produce} from "immer"

function toggleTodo(state, id) {
	return produce(state, draft => {
		const todo = draft.find(todo => todo.id === id)
		todo.done = !todo.done
	})
}

const baseState = [
	{
		id: "JavaScript",
		title: "Learn TypeScript",
		done: true
	},
	{
		id: "Immer",
		title: "Try Immer",
		done: false
	}
]

const nextState = toggleTodo(baseState, "Immer")
```

The above pattern of `toggleTodo` is quite typical; pass an existing state to `produce`, modify the `draft`, and then return the result. Since `state` isn't used for anything else than passing it on to `produce`, the above example can be simplified by using the _curried_ form of `produce`, where you pass `produce` only the recipe function, and `produce` will return a new function that will apply recipe to the base state. This allows us to shorten the above `toggleTodo` definition.

```javascript
import {produce} from "immer"

// curried producer:
const toggleTodo = produce((draft, id) => {
	const todo = draft.find(todo => todo.id === id)
	todo.done = !todo.done
})

const baseState = [
	/* as is */
]

const nextState = toggleTodo(baseState, "Immer")
```

Note that the `id` param has now become part of the recipe function! This pattern of having curried producers combines really neatly with for example the `useState` hook from React, as we will see on the next page.
