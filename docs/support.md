<div id="codefund"><!-- fallback content --></div>

Immer currently has 350.000 dependents on GitHub, and has almost 10.000.000 downloads per month. However, only the first 2 days of development has been sponsored (by Mendix), and all the development and maintenance after that has been a labor of love.

If you are enjoying Immer, and you are grateful for the package, or want to ensure its longevity, consider sponsoring the open collective on https://opencollective.com/immer or make a one time donation using [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/michelweststrate).
